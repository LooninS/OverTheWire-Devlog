# 🔐 OverTheWire: Bandit Wargame Journey

Welcome! This repository is a personal log and write-up collection of my journey through the **Bandit** wargame on [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/). Bandit is designed for absolute beginners to learn the basics of Linux, bash, and cybersecurity.

## 🧠 Why Bandit?

+ I'm solving Bandit to:
    - Strengthen my Linux and command-line skills. 
    - Build a habit of documenting and sharing my learning process.

## 📁 Structure

Each level has its own folder/file with:
- ✅ Objective of the level
- 🛠️ Commands used
- 💡 Explanation and reasoning

Example:

Level 0
===================
Goal: SSH into the server and find the password for the next level
```bash
man ssh # check the commands
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220```
