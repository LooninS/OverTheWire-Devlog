# Bandit Level 14 â†’ Level 15

## Level Goal
The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.

***

## Commands Used

- `cat`: To print the current password.
- `nc` (netcat): Used to establish a network connection and send data.

***

## Approach

1.  **Obtain Current Password:** Get the password for the current Bandit level (Bandit 14).
2.  **Send Password to Port:** Use `echo` to print the current password and pipe its output to `nc` (netcat). `nc` will then connect to `localhost` on port `30000` and send the password.
3.  **Retrieve Next Password:** The server on port 30000 will respond with the password for the next level (Bandit 15).

Example command:
```bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 | nc localhost 30000
```

## Key Concepts

- **Netcat (`nc`)**: netcat (often abbreviated to nc) is a computer networking utility for reading from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP.
- **Piping (`|`)**: Used to redirect the output of one command as the input to another command.
- **`localhost`**: It is a hostname that refers to the local machine.
- **Ports**: Ports are used to identify specific services or applications running on a computer.
