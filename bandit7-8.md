# Bandit Level 7 â†’ Level 8
## Level Goal
The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth
***
### Approach
This one is pretty easy. I solved it using `grep` which I have already used to solve previous levels. 
This is my solution:
```bash
bandit7@bandit:~$ cat data.txt  | grep "millionth"
```
The `cat` command display all the contents of `data.txt`, then `|` operator takes the output of cat command and give it to `grep` command, which displays the lline with the word 'millionth'
